  * Explored effects of strategic ambiguity in a 2-choice forced-response task relating to problem solving in a STEM domain. 
  * Built predictive classifier of usersâ€™ cognitive strategy based on response times using discriminant analysis and k-fold cross-validation. 
  * Discovered 70% of users adopted the more efficient non-rotaion strategy, and adoption of the alternate strategy was moderated by abstract reasoning ability.

  * Investigated the effect of stereoscopic viewing and tangible user interface location on STEM problem solving in a novel mixed reality apparatus.
  * Discovered interface location manipulation effects depended on user ability level : only low spatial ability users benefited from co-location of the physical and virtual objects.

* Visual Stimuli Generation: Developed and documented a programmatic stimuli generation process with [imagemagick] (https://imagemagick.org/index.php) on a Linux virtual machine and Adobe Photoshop.
    
* Data collection: Developed and maintained automated data collection workflows using batch tasks to sync files between the data collection workstations and data analysis workstations.
    
* Data processing: Scripted in Python to munge messy Excel files into tidy CSV files.
   
* Data analyis: Developed R scripts to run both locally and by our collaborators at University of Utah's Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute. The resulting end-to-end data visualization and analysis pipeline continued to be used after I moved on from the project.

* Co-authored paper: "Where are you? The effect of uncertainty and its visual representation on location judgments in GPS-like displays." Awarded 2016 Raymond Nickerson Best Paper Award in Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied.
  
* Presented research at all-hands meetings in Salt Lake City and Santa Barbara as well as at the 2016 CogSci conference in Pasadena, California.
