Trevor recently completed his PhD in Psychological and Brain Sciences under advisement of Mary Hegarty at University of California, Santa Barbara. His research has primarily focused on issues surrounding interaction design of virtual environments for spatial problem solving tasks. His Master's research involved engineering a tangible user interface and mirrored display apparatus that gave the haptic illusion of physically manipulating the virtual model. For his dissertation studies, he investigated cognitive strategy use and individual differences during the mental rotation task with novel molecular model stimuli. He employed model-based clustering on user response time distributions to classify people into two strategy groups and discriminant analysis to predict self-reported strategy use. One important finding was that common spatial ability measures predicted adherence to the slower error-prone mental rotation strategy, while abstract reasoning ability predicted use of a faster and more accurate non-rotation strategy.

Some highlights of Trevor's time in grad school include advising group projects for Advanced Research Methods Laboratory and having the opportunity to plan and present research with colleagues at cross-disciplinary multi-institution meetings for large NSF grants. He especially enjoys developing tools and analytic pipelines for students and colleagues to better express their data stories. He is currently looking for a position applying his training in Experimental Psychology and familiarity with scalable machine learning methods at a company or research group working on solving tomorrow's problems.
