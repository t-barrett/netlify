Trevor recently completed their PhD in Psychology studying Spatial Cognition and is looking to apply their data scientific skill set in Industry. His main research research interests have surrounded issues of interaction design in virtual environments. Trevor developed a research program studying how people use physical and virtual models to reason about spatial topics in STEM like organic chemistgry. In addition to my basic research program, I enjoyed advising Honor's Thesis research, teaching Advanced Research Methods Laboratory and mentoring group projects, as well as providing integral analysis and communication skills in several large collaborative multi-disciplinary research contexts. One of my favorite parts about what I do is developing the tools and analytics pipelines for students and colleagues to better express their data stories. Please reach out if you need an expert in experimental psychology, statistics, and scalable data analytic methods.

Moving towards Data Science professionally, I have grown to embrace reproducible research methods and workflows to continually monitor data integrity. I use Rmarkdown to create automated reports and presentations that can be programmatically audited and updated, collect data from various internal and external sources using APIs written in R, and manage large out-of-ram workloads using the split -> apply -> combine method to parallelize computation across distributed systems. With eight years of experience managing various custom (often klugy) data collection platforms, I find myself mostly working from the R IDE to gather data then delegate tasks to machine learning packages like Caret or external programming languages like Stan, TensorFlow, Julia, etc. I have experience working in Windows, Linux, HPC and cloud environments and am eager to share, learn, and integrate new methods alongside an awesome team.
