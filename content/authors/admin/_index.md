Trevor recently completed his PhD in Psychological and Brain Sciences under advisement of Mary Hegarty at University of California, Santa Barbara. Working in the [Spatial Thinking Lab](https://hegarty-lab.psych.ucsb.edu), his research primarily focused on issues surrounding interaction design of virtual environments for spatial problem solving tasks. Some highlights of Trevor's time in grad school include advising group projects for Advanced Research Methods Laboratory and having the opportunity to plan and present research with colleagues at interdisciplinary multi-institution meetings for large NSF grants. He especially enjoys developing tools and analytic pipelines for students and colleagues to better express their data stories.

Moving towards Data Science professionally, he has grown to embrace reproducible research methods with continual data integrity monitoring throughout the knowledge product lifecycle. He is capable of creating automated reports that can be programmatically audited and updated, has experience mining and warehousing data from various public (e.g. [Twitter](https://rtweet.info)) and private APIs, and can handle large out-of-memory workloads using [Split-Apply-Combine](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01) methods on distributed systems. With eight years of experience managing various data projects, he finds himself using Rstudio or Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, modeling in external ML packages, and doing Bayesian data analysis using the R interface to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org).  He is comfortable using Python for general programming tasks and has developed on Windows, Linux, high-performance computing, and hybrid multi-cloud environments. New on the job market, Trevor is eager to grow, share, and learn new methods to achieve impactful insights alongside an awesome team.
