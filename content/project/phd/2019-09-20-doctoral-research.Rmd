For his Doctoral research, he investigated cognitive strategy use and individual differences during the mental rotation task with novel molecular model stimuli. For data analysis he employed model-based clustering on user response time distributions that classified people into two distinct strategy groups. Discriminant analysis and k-fold cross validation showed that the classifier had a predictive error of about 30%. One important finding was that a common spatial ability measure (cube comparison) predicted adherence to the slower error-prone mental rotation strategy, while abstract reasoning ability predicted use of a faster and more accurate non-rotation strategy.
